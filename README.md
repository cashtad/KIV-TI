# Task
You will design a recognition KA that will accept all chains over {a,b} that do not end with the substring -babba-

Create a program that displays a transition graph with the initial state colored. The program can sequentially enter an input string from the keyboard. After entering one character, the automaton "performs a transition", i.e. the transition graph is displayed with the current state colored.
In addition to the letters of the input alphabet, the program can also process two special characters that allow to terminate the processing of the string and start processing of a new string (RESET) or terminate the program (STOP).
